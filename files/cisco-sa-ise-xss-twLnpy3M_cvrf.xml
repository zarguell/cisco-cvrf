  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the External RESTful Services (ERS) API of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated administrator of the web-based management interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xss-twLnpy3M ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xss-twLnpy3M"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ISE Software if ERS was enabled.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine Whether ERS is Enabled
For Cisco ISE releases 2.0 to 2.7, do the following:

Log in to the Cisco ISE web management interface.
Choose Administration &gt; System &gt; Settings.
Choose ERS Settings.
If Enable ERS for Read/Write is selected, the device is vulnerable.
If Disable ERS is selected, the device is not vulnerable.


For Cisco ISE Release 3.0, do the following:

Log in to the Cisco ISE web management interface.
Click the menu icon.
Choose Administration &gt; System &gt; Settings.
Choose ERS Settings.
If Enable ERS for Read/Write is selected, the device is vulnerable.
If Disable ERS is selected, the device is not vulnerable.


For Cisco ISE releases 3.1 and 3.2, do the following:

Log in to the Cisco ISE web management interface.
Click the menu icon.
Choose Administration &gt; System &gt; Settings.
Choose API Settings.
Choose the API Service Settings tab.
If ERS (Read/Write) is selected, the device is vulnerable.
If ERS (Read/Write) is not selected, the device is not vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
