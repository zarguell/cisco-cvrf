  CVE-2021-27853
A vulnerability in the processing of stacked Ethernet tag headers of multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the FHS feature of an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to the platforms forwarding frames when the upper-layer protocol cannot be determined to invoke a Layer 3 FHS feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending packets with stacked VLAN Ethernet headers. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the FHS feature of an affected device.

Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE ID: CVE-2021-27853
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 4.7
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

CVE-2021-27853: Additional Details

The IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 standard incorporates a priority-tagged frame whose tag header carries priority information but no VLAN identification information. The VLAN identifier is set to 0 and is typically carried in a single 802.1Q header between the source MAC address and the Ethertype/size field.

In networks where VLAN tagging is used, there is typically a single 802.1Q header between the source MAC address and the Ethertype/size field. IEEE 802.1AD has double tagging and includes the S-TAG and C-TAG headers between the source MAC address and the Ethertype/size field.

The IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 does not specify that there should be no more than two tags present, but Cisco products have a limit on how many tags can be inspected to establish the upper-layer protocols (determined by the Ethertype field), whether a packet is classified as IPv4 or IPv6, and whether it is subject to additional Layer 3 feature processing. If these things cannot be determined, the packet is forwarded based on the Layer 2 information, depending on the device configuration.

Depending on the implementation of the next device that receives the frame, the frame may be dropped as invalid or the priority tags may be removed and processed. These actions are dependent on the implementation of the receiving host operating system.
  CVE-2021-27853: Cisco Network Operating Systems
This section provides specific details about how the different affected Cisco network operating systems handle Ethernet frames with a VLAN ID 0 tag.

Cisco IOS Software â€“ Switches

By default, all of the affected Cisco IOS Switches process inbound packets with the frame header that contains a VLAN ID 0 tag. Cisco products have a limit on how many tags can be inspected to establish the upper-layer protocols.

Note: Cisco IOS Switches that have reached end of life have not been evaluated by the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT).

Cisco IOS XE Software â€“ Switches

By default, Cisco Catalyst 4500E Series switches process an inbound packet with the frame header that contains a VLAN ID 0 tag. Cisco products have a limit on how many tags can be inspected to establish the upper-layer protocols.

The default behavior of a Cisco IOS XE Switch is to drop all traffic that has a frame header that contains a VLAN ID 0 tag. The switch only processes frames with a VLAN ID 0 tag if the access port is configured as follows:


switchport voice vlan dot1p

Cisco IOS XE Software â€“ Routers

Cisco IOS XE devices that are configured with service instances handle the VLAN ID 0 tag in accordance with their configurations. For VLAN-based services, the top one or two tags are inspected based on configuration and map to the appropriate service instance on the longest match rules.

Service instance-based configurations that contain encapsulation dot1q priority-tagged, encapsulation dot1q priority-tagged exact, or encapsulation default are affected by this vulnerability.

The order of matching a service instance for VLAN ID 0 is based on encapsulation dot1q priority-tagged first and then encapsulation default. Cisco IOS XE Software does not match on encapsulation dot1q any for VLAN ID 0 tags.

Cisco IOS XR Software

Cisco IOS XR Software running on Layer 2 Transport interfaces handles a VLAN ID 0 tag in accordance with the configurations applied to the device. For port-based services, the packets are forwarded with no inspection. For VLAN-based services, either the top tag or the top two tags are inspected based on configuration and map to the appropriate attachment circuit based on the longest match rules. Fore more information, see IOS XR L2VPN Services and Features ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116453-technote-ios-xr-l2vpn-00.html#anc6"].

Configurations that contain encapsulation dot1q priority-tagged, encapsulation dot1q priority-tagged exact, or encapsulation default on Layer 2 Transport VLAN-based configurations are affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco NX-OS Software

By default, Cisco NX-OS Software processes an inbound packet with the frame header containing a VLAN ID 0 tag. The initial VLAN ID 0 tag is stripped and then processed in accordance with the rest of the packet contents. Cisco products have a limit on how many tags can be inspected to establish the upper-layer protocols.

Cisco Small Business Switches

By default, Cisco Small Business Switches process an inbound packet with the frame header that contains a VLAN ID 0 tag. Cisco products have a limit on how many tags can be inspected to establish the upper-layer protocols.
    CVE-2021-27854
CVE-2021-27854 examines the way frames are converted between 802.11 and 802.3 with the injection of VLAN tags in the SNAP headers.

Cisco evaluated this vulnerability for any impact to the security features on wireless access points when handling these frame conversions. Cisco found that no configured FHS features were bypassed.

CVE ID: CVE-2021-27854
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 4.7
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
    CVE-2021-27861
A vulnerability in the Ethernet processing of multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the FHS feature of an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of SNAP/LLC Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending packets with a crafted (or not crafted, depending on the product) SNAP/LLC Ethernet header. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the FHS feature of an affected device.

Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability for some products.

  CVE-2021-27861: Cisco Network Operating Systems
This section provides specific details about how the different affected Cisco network operating systems handle SNAP/LLC Ethernet frames.

Cisco IOS Software â€“ Switches

The affected Cisco IOS Software products forward SNAP/LLC frames without additional FHS feature inspection.

Cisco IOS XR Software

The affected Cisco IOS XR Software products forward SNAP/LLC frames without additional FHS feature inspection.

Cisco NX-OS Software

The affected Cisco NX-OS Software products forward SNAP/LLC frames without any additional FHS feature inspection.

Cisco Small Business Switches

The affected Cisco Small Business Switches correctly apply FHS features for SNAP/LLC frames with a length field of up to 1,500. However, SNAP/LLC frames with lengths of 1,501 through 1,535 are forwarded without additional FHS feature inspection.
    CVE-2021-27862
CVE-2021-27862 examines the way frames are converted between 802.3 to 802.11 and the length field.

Cisco evaluated this vulnerability for any impact to the security features on wireless access points when handling these frame conversions. Cisco found that no configured FHS features were bypassed.

CVE ID: CVE-2021-27862

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There are workarounds that address some of these vulnerabilities.
    CVE-2021-27853
Administrators may drop packets that cannot have their ethertype detected using a Layer 2 access control list (ACL) or where tags are not expected to drop tagged traffic. If a single dot1P header is received, it will still be processed correctly if the network operating system supports it.

The following are examples of Layer 2 ACLs that could be implemented on access ports where FHS has been configured:

Cisco IOS Software â€“ Switches


!
mac access-list extended CSCwa14271
 permit any any 0x86DD 0x0
 permit any any 0x800 0x0
 permit any any 0x806 0x0

interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport access vlan 5
 switchport voice vlan dot1p
 ipv6 nd raguard attach-policy HOSTS
 mac access-group CSCwa14271 in
!

Cisco IOS XE Software â€“ Switches

For Cisco IOS XE Software on switches, impact to all FHS features occurs on Cisco IOS Software releases 17.6.1 and later, but earlier than the first fixed release. The issue will not be seen if the access port VLAN also has an active switched virtual interface (SVI). If there are access ports in VLAN 5, for example, this issue will be observed only if interface vlan 5 is not configured. To mitigate this issue for vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS Software, administrators can ensure that each VLAN assigned to access ports has a corresponding SVI configured.

For Cisco IOS XE Software on switches, Dynamic ARP Inspection is affected on all releases. Administrators can configure static ARP entries for the default gateways and critical servers and hosts off the segments that are being protected to protect the critical assets in the environment.

Cisco IOS XE Software â€“ Routers

For configurations that have a service instance with encapsulation priority-tagged and where the environment needs to examine only the first tag (depending on the platform), administrators can either add the keyword exact after the encapsulation priority-tagged or filter on the ethertype field with encapsulation priority-tagged etype ipv4 , ipv6.

For environments that do not have encapsulation priority-tagged assigned to a service instance, to prevent packets that are tagged with dot1p at the front of the headers from being forwarded, administrators can configure a service instance that is not assigned to a bridge domain with encapsulation priority-tagged.

Cisco IOS XR Software

For configurations that have an l2transport sub interface configured with encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged and where the environment needs to examine only the first tag (depending on the platform), administrators can add the keyword exact after the encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged.

For environments that do not have encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged assigned to an l2transport sub interface, to prevent packets that are tagged with dot1p at the front of the headers from being forwarded, administrators can configure l2transport sub interfaces that are not assigned to a bridge domain with encapsulation dot1q priority-tagged and encapsulation dot1ad priority-tagged.

Cisco NX-OS Software

 permit any any
!

Cisco Small Business Switches

To ensure that FHS works correctly on access ports, install a MAC ACL to deny only tagged frames (because they are not to be expected on an access port) or to permit only ARP, IPv4, and IPv6 on all access ports. The following is an example from the Cisco Sx250, 350, and 550 Series Smart Switches and the Cisco Business 250 and 350 Series Smart Switches:


mac access-list extended arp-ip-ip6
permit any any 806 0000 ace-priority 1
permit any any 800 0000 ace-priority 2
permit any any 86dd 0000 ace-priority 3


      CVE-2021-27861
The principle for mitigating CVE-2021-27861 is to drop any packets that cannot have their Layer 3 protocol detected using a Layer 2 ACL.

The following are examples of Layer 2 ACLs that could be implemented on access ports where FHP has been configured:

      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>There are workarounds that address some of these vulnerabilities.
    CVE-2021-27853
Administrators may drop packets that cannot have their ethertype detected using a Layer 2 access control list (ACL) or where tags are not expected to drop tagged traffic. If a single dot1P header is received, it will still be processed correctly if the network operating system supports it.

The following are examples of Layer 2 ACLs that could be implemented on access ports where FHS has been configured:

Cisco IOS Software â€“ Switches


!
mac access-list extended CSCwa14271
 permit any any 0x86DD 0x0
 permit any any 0x800 0x0
 permit any any 0x806 0x0
 deny   any any
!
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport access vlan 5
 switchport voice vlan dot1p
 ipv6 nd raguard attach-policy HOSTS
 mac access-group CSCwa14271 in
!

Cisco IOS XE Software â€“ Switches

For Cisco IOS XE Software on switches, impact to all FHS features occurs on Cisco IOS Software releases 17.6.1 and later, but earlier than the first fixed release. The issue will not be seen if the access port VLAN also has an active switched virtual interface (SVI). If there are access ports in VLAN 5, for example, this issue will be observed only if interface vlan 5 is not configured. To mitigate this issue for vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS Software, administrators can ensure that each VLAN assigned to access ports has a corresponding SVI configured.

For Cisco IOS XE Software on switches, Dynamic ARP Inspection is affected on all releases. Administrators can configure static ARP entries for the default gateways and critical servers and hosts off the segments that are being protected to protect the critical assets in the environment.

Cisco IOS XE Software â€“ Routers

For configurations that have a service instance with encapsulation priority-tagged and where the environment needs to examine only the first tag (depending on the platform), administrators can either add the keyword exact after the encapsulation priority-tagged or filter on the ethertype field with encapsulation priority-tagged etype ipv4 , ipv6.

For environments that do not have encapsulation priority-tagged assigned to a service instance, to prevent packets that are tagged with dot1p at the front of the headers from being forwarded, administrators can configure a service instance that is not assigned to a bridge domain with encapsulation priority-tagged.

Cisco IOS XR Software

For configurations that have an l2transport sub interface configured with encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged and where the environment needs to examine only the first tag (depending on the platform), administrators can add the keyword exact after the encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged.

For environments that do not have encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged assigned to an l2transport sub interface, to prevent packets that are tagged with dot1p at the front of the headers from being forwarded, administrators can configure l2transport sub interfaces that are not assigned to a bridge domain with encapsulation dot1q priority-tagged and encapsulation dot1ad priority-tagged.

Cisco Small Business Switches

To ensure that FHS works correctly on access ports, install a MAC ACL to deny only tagged frames (because they are not to be expected on an access port) or to permit only ARP, IPv4, and IPv6 on all access ports. The following is an example from the Cisco Sx250, 350, and 550 Series Smart Switches and the Cisco Business 250 and 350 Series Smart Switches:


mac access-list extended arp-ip-ip6
permit any any 806 0000 ace-priority 1
permit any any 800 0000 ace-priority 2
permit any any 86dd 0000 ace-priority 3


      CVE-2021-27861
The principle for mitigating CVE-2021-27861 is to drop any packets that cannot have their Layer 3 protocol detected using a Layer 2 ACL.

The following are examples of Layer 2 ACLs that could be implemented on access ports where FHP has been configured:

While these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</Description>

    CVE-2021-27853
Administrators may drop packets that cannot have their ethertype detected using a Layer 2 access control list (ACL) or where tags are not expected to drop tagged traffic. If a single dot1P header is received, it will still be processed correctly if the network operating system supports it.

The following are examples of Layer 2 ACLs that could be implemented on access ports where FHS has been configured:

Cisco IOS Software â€“ Switches


!
mac access-list extended CSCwa14271
 permit any any 0x86DD 0x0
 permit any any 0x800 0x0
 permit any any 0x806 0x0
 deny   any any
!
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport access vlan 5
 switchport voice vlan dot1p
 ipv6 nd raguard attach-policy HOSTS
 mac access-group CSCwa14271 in
!

Cisco IOS XE Software â€“ Switches

For Cisco IOS XE Software on switches, impact to all FHS features occurs on Cisco IOS Software releases 17.6.1 and later, but earlier than the first fixed release. The issue will not be seen if the access port VLAN also has an active switched virtual interface (SVI). If there are access ports in VLAN 5, for example, this issue will be observed only if interface vlan 5 is not configured. To mitigate this issue for vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS Software, administrators can ensure that each VLAN assigned to access ports has a corresponding SVI configured.

For Cisco IOS XE Software on switches, Dynamic ARP Inspection is affected on all releases. Administrators can configure static ARP entries for the default gateways and critical servers and hosts off the segments that are being protected to protect the critical assets in the environment.

Cisco IOS XE Software â€“ Routers

For configurations that have a service instance with encapsulation priority-tagged and where the environment needs to examine only the first tag (depending on the platform), administrators can either add the keyword exact after the encapsulation priority-tagged or filter on the ethertype field with encapsulation priority-tagged etype ipv4 , ipv6.

For environments that do not have encapsulation priority-tagged assigned to a service instance, to prevent packets that are tagged with dot1p at the front of the headers from being forwarded, administrators can configure a service instance that is not assigned to a bridge domain with encapsulation priority-tagged.

Cisco IOS XR Software

For configurations that have an l2transport sub interface configured with encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged and where the environment needs to examine only the first tag (depending on the platform), administrators can add the keyword exact after the encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged.

For environments that do not have encapsulation dot1q|dot1ad priority-tagged assigned to an l2transport sub interface, to prevent packets that are tagged with dot1p at the front of the headers from being forwarded, administrators can configure l2transport sub interfaces that are not assigned to a bridge domain with encapsulation dot1q priority-tagged and encapsulation dot1ad priority-tagged.

Cisco NX-OS Software

mac access-list drop_three_tags
 deny any any 0x8100
 deny any any 0x88a8

 mac port access-group drop_three_tags
!


Cisco Small Business Switches

To ensure that FHS works correctly on access ports, install a MAC ACL to deny only tagged frames (because they are not to be expected on an access port) or to permit only ARP, IPv4, and IPv6 on all access ports. The following is an example from the Cisco Sx250, 350, and 550 Series Smart Switches and the Cisco Business 250 and 350 Series Smart Switches:


mac access-list extended arp-ip-ip6
permit any any 806 0000 ace-priority 1
permit any any 800 0000 ace-priority 2
permit any any 86dd 0000 ace-priority 3


      CVE-2021-27861
The principle for mitigating CVE-2021-27861 is to drop any packets that cannot have their Layer 3 protocol detected using a Layer 2 ACL.

The following are examples of Layer 2 ACLs that could be implemented on access ports where FHP has been configured:

No mitigations or workarounds.

While these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</Description>
